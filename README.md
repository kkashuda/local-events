#### getting started: 

After you've cloned the repository cd into **sinatra-portfolio-project** and run **bundle install**. Once bundler is done, run **rake db:migrate** to establish the database. Now go ahead and start up a local server using either command, **rackup** or **shotgun**. If you plan to edit the code, and want to leave the server running opt in for **shotgun**. Once the server is up and running, navigate to the localhost site given in the terminal.
